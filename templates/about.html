<br>
<br>
<p class="body-text" Style="font-size: 20px; font-family:'Thasadith', sans-serif; margin: 0px 175px 0px 175px">My name is Jacob.  I live in Tulsa, OK with my two children.  Two years ago, I had to leave my career on the east coast and move home.  Unemployment, depression, lack of direction, and sloth all have taken their toll on me. Iâ€™m resolved to take full charge of my life this coming year. 2019 will be my best year yet.</p>

<p class="body-text" Style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Thasadith', sans-serif; margin: 0px 175px 0px 175px">Staying focused and motivated is easier when I hold myself accountable by being totally transparent about my progress.  This page exists as a way for me to be transparent and honest with myself as well as any who might be interested in my journey.</p>

<p class="body-text" Style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Thasadith', sans-serif; margin: 0px 175px 0px 175px">The Home page lists any new achievements or news.  The Blog is, well, a blog, meant to record my day-to-day progress and achievements. The Goals page segments into areas of my life and their corresponding resolutions.  The task is daunting, I know.  I may not achieve them all.  However, the more challenges undertaken, the more victories to be celebrated.</p>

As my web dev skills grow throughout the year, this page will grow, change, and improve.</p>
