The most commonly lamented facet of adult life is a loss of freedom and youthful irresponsibility; that that one is strapped down by bills, appointments, work, maintaining friendships after 30, and the millstone of parenthood.  Usually it is expressed as something like “Man I wish I still lived with my parents and didn’t have to pay bills.”  For the happiest lot, these fetters are the comforting confines of a life well lived. These people draw meaning from the well-defined bounds of their reach.  For others, they chafe for some years then either become velvet from bracing against them or become invisible through acceptance and numbness.  Then there are those who never adjust to adult life.  These mad unfortunates strain against societal expectations in a vain effort to reclaim what they once had in their youths.  They either shrivel in bitter resentment and regret or simply rot on the vine and die.  I have spent the time since my return to Tulsa dreaming of the first, living the second, while hanging above the humming void of the third.<br><br>
Those who know me at all know that I’ve had a rough couple of years.  The days of constant sorrow extend back the better part of a decade, but don’t warrant recounting.  I’ve yet to choose a name for this time, but I’m partial to Years Wandering in the Desert, Lennon’s Lost Weekend, or The Garden of Gethsemane.  It certainly felt like all of them.  To salve my anxiety, I would tell myself a luxurious lie: “You are Aeneas in Carthage, dallying until you leave to found Rome.  Fato profugus sum.” That plush, anodyne thought was sometimes all that could bring me to the anesthesia of Morpheus’ arms.  And in that way, it was much needed.   But what it quietly does is shift the blame away from and eschew the point of any self work.  If Aeneas or myself are meant to suffer, then so it was woven in the scroll of the fates and to challenge them is to risk a hubristic downfall.<br><br>
It is long since time for a change.  I’m not Aeneas, neither a fugitive by fate or a founder of Rome.  I’m someone looking to have some control in my life and arrive at happy adulthood.  Where my Officia are a climbing rope and not straps that tie me down.  I cannot achieve that by dulling myself with fugue states and wishing.  When I noticed that the new year was fast approaching, I decided to use the cliché of new year, new me.  I then arrived at the idea of this page as a way for me to share my goals and habits as I work on them while working on my web dev skills.
<br><br>
So tonight, watching the minutes tick towards midnight, I toast to the motivated, positive, dynamic person that I know I can be. It’s time to do the work I’ve been putting off.  Here is to using the ties that bind to scale that goddamned mountain.  And may the new year bring you all the things you desire.
<br><br>
Here is to 2019: the best year yet.

P.S.: I promise the other posts won’t be as dense and verbose.  No promises on the classics references, though.
